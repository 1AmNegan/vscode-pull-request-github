# VS Code Pull Request Provider for GitHub

VS Code Pull Request Provider is a data-provder for pull requests that enables a GitHub integration to list and manage pull requests directly from VS Code. 

The goal of this provider is to handle the integration pieces between the VS Code UI and the GitHub APIs, covering:
- Authentication
- Listing of PR
- Workflows around PRs
- and more.
